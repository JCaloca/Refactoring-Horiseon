# Refactoring Horiseon

## Description

Refactoring Horisean is an exercise in which I display my ability to debug and refactor code. I use the opportunity to change the original HTML elements to be semantic in nature in order to ease the reading of code. The original CSS was very verbose and at points redundant. I consolidated much of it down for long-term sustainability.

## Usage

The following screenshot shows the work done to consolidate the code of the side bar in HTML and CSS by changing the elements and associated .class selectors.
